            Throughout my entire adult life, my preliminary goal was to be good
            at what I do and build a better version of myself in terms of skill
            sets and knowledge. Yet, there was always this lingering feeling of
            “I do not belong here” or “my full potential is trapped.” Let me
            start from the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fascinated by other cultures, this journey of mine started by
            enrolling in a Bachelor’s degree in English Translation, which led
            me to my first job and eventually becoming an ESL teacher. These
            experiences allowed me to gain priceless interpersonal skills, adapt
            to diverse work environments, and, most importantly, developing a
            creative mind to develop effective solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these achievements, something was missing. I had been so
            blind of my passion for technology and computer science, even though
            I used to spend hours and hours behind the computer. In 2022, it hit
            me to enroll in an online course by HarvardX, Introduction to
            Computer Science. The time for the big change was already at my
            doorstep without me even knowing it! I remember the days I struggled
            for hours, but there was something dragging me along and holding me
            to that chair; something that made me spent countless hours
            exploring and learning on my own. That something was THE thing that
            I was looking for all these years, a true passion. In 2024, I
            applied for a Master’s degree in Information Technology and
            graduated with a GPA of 3.7 as the second best in the department.
            Currently, I am looking forward to finding a position related to
            this field with excitement.

            <strong>Dota 2</strong> is my favorite video game, and it has been a
            big part of my free time since 2017. Over the years, I have
            dedicated more than 4,300 hours to playing it, which reflects not
            only my passion but also the depth of my engagement with the game. I
            consider myself a true fan, not just of playing, but also of
            following the competitive scene. Every year, I eagerly watch The
            International, Dota 2’s biggest tournament, where the best teams
            from around the world compete for glory, if not for million-dollar
            prizes. I enjoy supporting my favorite players and teams, analyzing
            their strategies, and sometimes even trying to apply what I’ve
            learned to my own gameplay. For me, Dota 2 is more than just a
            pastime; it is both a source of entertainment and a way to connect
            with a global community of players and fans.

            <strong>V for Vendetta</strong>, a masterpiece, a philosophy, the
            world unmasked. This film changed my life forever. It taught me what
            belief truly means and how deeply we are meant to hold on to our
            values, even when the world challenges them. I have watched it more
            than a dozen times, and each viewing feels like the first, bringing
            me the same excitement and inspiration to the moon and back. To some
            audiences, it may appear as just another superhero movie with
            fantasy elements. But to me, it is nothing less than a modern
            tragedy, a poetic reflection on freedom, identity, and resistance.
            It captures the art of life and war, reminding us how crucial it is
            to fight back against oppression and to strive to make things right,
            even when the odds seem impossible.

            <strong>Die-cast Model Cars</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe everyone should have a collection that reflects their
            personal interests. For me, as a lifelong car enthusiast, collecting
            die-cast model cars is more than just a hobby, it’s a passion.
            There’s something deeply satisfying about curating a collection that
            represents both your taste and your dedication.
          </p>
          <p>
            When most people hear the word collection, they often imagine rare,
            high-value items that require significant financial investment. But
            a collection doesn’t have to be expensive to be meaningful. My own
            collection consists of models from a variety of brands, many of
            which are quite affordable. What matters most is the joy and sense
            of fulfillment I get from expanding it whenever I find a new piece.
            Over time, each car becomes a story, a memory, and a small
            reflection of the larger automotive world that fascinates me.
